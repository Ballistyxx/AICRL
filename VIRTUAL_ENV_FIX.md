# Virtual Environment Fix for AICRL GUI

## Problem

The GUI was failing to load models with the error:
```
Failed to load model; No module named 'stable_baselines3'
```

This happened because the GUI was not using the virtual environment where `stable_baselines3` is installed.

## Solution

The fix involves multiple components to ensure the GUI properly accesses the virtual environment:

### 1. Automatic Path Detection

Both `gui_main.py` and `modules/training_runner.py` now include automatic detection and loading of the virtual environment:

```python
def ensure_venv_access():
    """Ensure access to virtual environment packages."""
    try:
        import stable_baselines3
    except ImportError:
        # Try to add venv site-packages to path
        current_dir = Path(__file__).parent.absolute()
        venv_site_packages = current_dir / "AICRL" / "lib" / "python3.10" / "site-packages"
        
        if venv_site_packages.exists():
            sys.path.insert(0, str(venv_site_packages))
```

### 2. GUI Launcher Script

`activate_venv_gui.py` - A dedicated launcher that:
- Validates the virtual environment
- Checks for stable_baselines3 availability  
- Launches the GUI with proper environment

### 3. Test Script

`test_complete_fix.py` - Comprehensive testing that verifies:
- Virtual environment path detection
- stable_baselines3 import capability
- Module instantiation
- Model discovery functionality

### 4. Shell Script Runner

`run_gui.sh` - Simple bash script that:
- Runs pre-flight checks
- Launches GUI if all tests pass
- Provides clear error messages

## Usage Options

### Option 1: Direct Python (Recommended)
```bash
python3 gui_main.py
```
The GUI now automatically detects and uses the virtual environment.

### Option 2: Using the Launcher
```bash
python3 activate_venv_gui.py
```
Provides additional validation and error reporting.

### Option 3: Using Shell Script
```bash
chmod +x run_gui.sh
./run_gui.sh
```
Includes pre-flight checks and comprehensive error handling.

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
python3 test_complete_fix.py
```

This will run through all the tests and confirm:
- ✅ Virtual environment detection
- ✅ stable_baselines3 import
- ✅ Module creation
- ✅ Model discovery
- ✅ Environment creation

## What Was Fixed

1. **Python Path Management**: The GUI now automatically adds the virtual environment's site-packages to the Python path
2. **Import Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to venv path when imports fail
3. **Environment Validation**: Pre-flight checks ensure everything is working before GUI launch
4. **Multiple Launch Options**: Several ways to run the GUI with proper environment

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - The virtual environment issue has been resolved. Users can now:

- Load existing trained models from the `/models` directory
- Generate layouts without import errors
- Access all stable_baselines3 functionality
- Use the GUI with full functionality

The fix is backward compatible and doesn't require changes to the virtual environment itself.
